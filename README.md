# Cpt.Flint-Ch18-SocNetwork-API

## Description

I undertook this project with the idea to build an API for a social network web application that allows users to share thoughts and reactions to friends' thoughts, along with creating a list of friends. Routing was accomplished with Express.js, a database with MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM. Through the process of creating this I sharpened my skills with MongoDB and gained further experience in making the backend elements of a full-stack application come together.
